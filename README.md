# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform
- File structure
- block overflow
- Transition

## Plan on improving the project

Add your ideas here :)
I would like to add more animation and transformation to the
website. It will be more realisitc if the BOOK A TABLE section has some avalability to choose to. Because there's sometime you can't really choose if it's full.
